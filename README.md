#scripts

A collection of random personal scripts I've accumulated over the years, some of
which are now well over a decade old. Most are in python (always python3), some
are in bash.

This repo is mainly for my personal use across the various machines I work with
but it's possible others will find one or two things in here that are useful.
I'm not putting much time into maintaining or evolving most of these, but if you
see anything thats obviously wrong or missing let me know.

The files include a standard header that defines which machines I deploy them
onto (its the `fetch_scripts.py` script that does that. Some of them depend on
code in my [pythonpath repo](https://github.com/jodysankey/pythonpath.git).

Checkout with `git clone https://github.com/jodysankey/scripts.git`
